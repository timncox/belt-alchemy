# belt-alchemy

**Belt** — live vocal processor: pitch correction, four diatonic harmony
voices, a doubler and a formant control — for the
[Hermetic Modular Alchemy Lab V2](https://hermeticmodular.com/modules/alchemy-lab),
built on the [Alchemy SDK](https://github.com/hermetic-modular/alchemy-sdk).

Same C engine as [schwung-belt](https://github.com/timncox/schwung-belt) for
the Ableton Move, recompiled for six pots on two pages, three buttons, six
CV jacks and 102 LEDs. Sing into J1/J2; the module corrects you to the KEY
and SCALE at the RETUNE speed and stacks up to four harmonies that walk the
scale from what you sing. The KEY ring is a tuner.

**Status: v0.1.0 builds and passes its native tests. Nothing has been heard
yet.** See `DESIGN.md` for the control map, what is verified and what is not.
The open question is CPU: seven pitch-shifting voices on one Cortex-M7 has
not been measured.

## Build

Requires `arm-none-eabi-gcc`, `make`, `dfu-util`.

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules <this repo>
cd belt-alchemy
make libdaisy        # once
make                 # build/belt_alchemy.bin
make test            # native tests, no hardware
```

## Flash

Front USB-C with the factory bootloader: hold B3 during the ~2 s boot
window (rings spin a warm-white comet), the rings switch to a slow breathe,
then:

```sh
make program-dfu
```

or the [web programmer](https://hermeticmodular.com/program). Once this
firmware is running on the front port, `make program-live` reboots and
flashes without touching the module.

Bench setup (Hermetic's intdfu bootloader on the Seed's micro-USB): same
gesture on the micro-USB port; build with `BENCH_USB=1` if you want HostLink
there too.

## Firmware on the SD card

Put `.bin` files built for the Alchemy Lab bootloader in a folder named
`alchemy` on a FAT32 card. Hold B2+B3 for two seconds, tap B1 to the
Firmware page, pick a file with the top-left pot, then turn the top-right
pot down and all the way up. It writes, verifies, and reboots into the
chosen firmware. Every firmware in this family (Smack, Mark, Belt) carries
the same page, so the card is the module's library and any of them can
hand the module to any other.

## The site

`docs/index.html` is the operation manual, a single file meant for GitHub
Pages from `main:/docs`. Its panel drawing is generated from the SDK's KiCad
front-panel template by `tools/emit_panel_geometry.py`; run it with
`--check` before publishing and `--write` after the template changes, and
never hand-edit the coordinates. The repository URL the page links to is one
constant at the top of the file.

## Files on the card over USB

`tools/hostlink-fs.mjs` speaks HostLink's filesystem block, so images reach
the card without pulling it:

```sh
node tools/hostlink-fs.mjs info
node tools/hostlink-fs.mjs ls /alchemy
node tools/hostlink-fs.mjs put build/belt_alchemy.bin /alchemy/belt_alchemy.bin --overwrite
```

The picker lists files in on-disk order, one dot each, so the order you
upload them is the order the FILE pot walks.

## Family

`smack-alchemy`, `mark-alchemy` and this repository share, by copy, the
picker, the SDRAM allocator, the linker script, the card tool and the shape
of the Makefile and main file. A fix in one belongs in all three.

## Not a Hermetic Modular product

Custom firmware. Hermetic Modular did not write, test or endorse it; ask
here, not there.

## License

MIT (this firmware). The vendored engine is Tim Cox's; see the file headers.
