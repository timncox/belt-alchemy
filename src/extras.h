/*
 * The one value no control on the panel can express, carried in the preset

 *
 *   cpu_peak  The worst-case audio-block load seen during the PREVIOUS
 *             session, replayed on a ring at boot. Seven TD-PSOLA voices on
 *             one Cortex-M7 is the open question of this port, and the live
 *             alarm on B2 can only be read by someone watching it, which you
 *             are not while singing.
 *
 * Every Alchemy firmware in this family (Smack, Mark, Belt) has its own tag
 * here, so a slot 0 written by one of them fails the schema gate in the next
 * and lands in that firmware's first-boot defaults rather than being read as
 * its own settings.
